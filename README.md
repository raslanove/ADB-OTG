# Wireless ADB ⚡ OTG

This project is a fork of the [ADB-OTG](https://github.com/KhunHtetzNaing/ADB-OTG) developed by [Khun Htetz Naing](https://github.com/KhunHtetzNaing).

***⚡ Enable wireless ADB without a computer [No Need ROOT] ⚡***

For Android phones running Android < 11, you can enable wireless ADB by connecting two Android phones to each other. For Android >= 11, just use enable it from the developer options.
This app doesn't require root on either of the devices.

## Steps

* Enable USB-degugging on the target device, the one you want to enable wireless debugging on (client).
* Install the app on another device (host). Download [here](https://github.com/raslanove/Wireless-ADB-OTG/releases).
* Connect the two devices using a USB cable and an OTG adapter (which phone is directly connected to the adapter makes a difference in which device becomes the client and which becomes the host. You may need to reverse the cable for things to work).
* Use the app to enable wireless debugging.
